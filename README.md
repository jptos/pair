Non-IFW PAIR data tabs. Includes basic application information. Not as complete as published application data.

pf.pl - A perl script for pulling PAIR data

usage: pf.pl [<Application Number>] [CSV]

If no arguments are provided, the script will crawl ReedTech's public data. As of September 2015, there are approximately 5.2 million records. If you don't feel like generating your own db, feel free to download the quarterly dataset posted in the /data folder.'

You will need the following components to run this script: DBI:SQLite 


This is a script designed to populate a SQLITE db (or optionally, a collection of CSV tables) with PAIR metadata. Data is arranged in tables according to the PTO's PAIR layout information. The code is designed to politely pull data using gsutil and afterwards arrange it in the following tables:
